                <p> To my dearest!</p>
                <p> It's already half of the year and We only keep growing together. 
                    We've come a long way together. We had our ups and down and we fight on small things sometimes.
                    But you never gave up on me. I'll never give up on you too. I want to be with you for the rest
                    of my life. I cherish every moments we have and I always want to be with you. I appreciate all the 
                    things you do for me, even the thought of me. I appreciate that you always make time for me, 
                   I appreciate that you try to learn my hobbies just so you could spend time with me more, I appreciate 
                    that you're always supporting me in things that I do, I appreciate that you are patient with me, 
                    I appreciate that you want to be with me. Your love is what makes me keep going in life. Sometimes I 
                    just can't wait to do the things we planned together, but it's part of our journey. We can't skip nor miss
                    any moments together just to be in the said future we planned. We'll be there soon and this journey
                    will be worth it! 
                </p>
                <p>Thank you for being with me even when I have nothing.</p>
                <p>I love you ❤️</p>
